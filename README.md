# Can we predict wine quality?
* Compared model performance on how well we can predict wine quality ratings from a list of objective features of the wine (pH level, residual sugar, alcohol content, etc.)
* Compared the performance of 4 different models: ordinary least squares, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net.
* Utilized cross validation to choose the tuning parameters in order to improve model performance.

# Classifying which emails are spam
