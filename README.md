# Can we predict how good a wine tastes?
* Utilized different regression models to predict wine quality ratings from a list of objective features of the wine (pH level, residual sugar, alcohol content, etc.)
* Compared the performance of 4 different models: ordinary least squares, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net.
* Utilized cross validation to choose the tuning parameters in order to improve model performance.

# How has the pandemic affected New York City's public transportation ridership?
* Compared two main public transportations: subway and bus. How many people relied on these public transportations before the pandemic? How many of them still use public transportation during the pandemic?
* Plotted the number of COVID-19 cases against public transportation ridership. Does a spike in COVID-19 cases directly correlate with less people riding public transportation?

# Trump Tweets
* Created data visualizations from Donald Trump's tweets.
* During the 2016 presidential campaign, it was theorized that Donald Trump's tweets from Android devices were written by him personally, and the tweets from iPhones were from his staff. I plotted the number of tweets from each device and the time when they were usually posted to see if our data supported this claim.
* Utilized VADER, a sentiment analysis algorithm to observe the difference of polarity scores of certain words like "nytimes" and "fox".

# Classifying which emails are spam
* Utilized logistic regression to classify emails in order to predict whether they are spam emails or real emails.

# Can we use campaign finance data to predict who wins a primary election?
* Utilized a random forest classifier on campaign finance data and endorsement data to predict which candidates will win a primary election.
